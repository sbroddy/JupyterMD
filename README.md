# JupyterMD

In order to familiarize myself with Jupyter notebooks, 
JupyterHub, JupyterLab, and binder I wanted a notebook
to do something semiuseful with SAML XML Metadata.  Since 
Baseline expectations v2 is underway in InCommon, I created
an example of generating a pie chart for IdPs with and
without an errorURL in several federations.
